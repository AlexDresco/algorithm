# Algorithm

Week 10 at Makers: We spent this week looking at Algorithm Complexity. 

Overview of the week:
* I used Java to write my code and worked independently
* Create a framework to time different algorithms and compare their efficiency (Time.java)
* Write your own algorithms, trying to be as efficient as possible analysing the data structure

## Timing code

To start, I looked at how fast some standard library functions run and compared how long it took when the array was 10, 100, 1000 etc. times bigger. 


* ```last```
* ```reverse```
* ```shuffle```
* ```sort```

See Algorithms.numbers in the source file. 
(Add screenshots at the end of the project)

## Build your own algorithms
Shuffling
Implement your own algorithm for shuffling (you cannot use .shuffle).

Reversing
Implement your own algorithm for reversing an array (you cannot use .reverse).

Mechacoach Pairing
Given a list of students names, create all possible pairings.

## Making algorithms more efficient
* Know your data structures: some common operations were expensive (remove in the middle of an array)
* Change the structure of the algorithm: Notice parts of your algorithm that repeat the same operations on the same elements. Is there a way you can only do these operations once?
